Scrapes Images Using Beautiful Soup

<b>Motivation:</b> Managing an eCommerce website, I wanted to upload a new product that we had just received. The vendor had given me permission to use his photos, but didn't have them available in any convenient format (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.). I was asked to simply download them from the site -- as to which I thought >100 photos (yes, I think in symbols), multiple links to click for each one, individual wait time between each download, AND the need to rename them individually. Nah, would rather not. And so was born this simple scraper/parser.
